<h1 align="center">Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Baalateja</h1>

I'm a physics and mathematics graduate with a bent for computing in constant pursuit of mastery over the machine at all levels of abstraction. I'm also a big-time fanboy of robust, scalable engineering and fast execution speeds. 

I previously worked on hacking together methods and tools for computational physics in neutrino phenomenology.

I'm currently grinding on [ZAPTrack](https://zaptrack.store/) to build systems and AI for robots in AgTech that aim to automate organic food production with a focus on scaling organic farming through intelligent equipment and automation in farming processing for mid-size organic farmers. 

I started writing code and tinkering with systems as a hobby over a decade ago, beginning my career as a scripter/modder for the GTA series of video games. These days, I spend my time recreationally hopping between

- quantum information and computing
- numerical methods & analysis
- scientific computing
- data science and data engineering
- AI/ML/DL/CV/NLP
- robotics & automation
- web, mobile, & desktop development
- game development
- systems engineering
- computation theory
- programming language design & type theory
- devops & infrastructure design

in no particular order. 

Find me tinkering at
