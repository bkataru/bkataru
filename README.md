I'm a:
- physics grad with a bent for all things computing
- generalist/polymath/autodidact in constant pursuit of mastery over the machine at all levels of abstraction
- big-time fanboy of robust, scalable engineering, and fast execution speeds

I like:
- physical systems
- software systems
- hardware systems

I previously worked on:
- hacking together methods and tools for computational physics in neutrino phenomenology.
- building systems and AI for robotics in AgTech and automated precision agriculture.
- building, maintaining, and improving tools and systems for on-prem IT/network observability.

I'm currently hacking on an intersection of:
 - the fundamentals of programming languages such as v, nim, swift, rust, go, zig, odin, c3, hare, mojo: the ideas behind modern day, high performance, pedal-to-the-metal systems programming, and how they abstract the many moving parts in a machine's architecture.
- building low overhead, safe, and fast/efficient systems for AI/ML inference pipelines, agentic (gen) AI workflows, media processing tasks, HPC/computational physics routines, and general-purpose scientific computing systems using modern systems programming methodologies.
- python, agentic orchestration frameworks, and designing multi-step AI agent systems.
- typescript, UI frameworks, and building chatbot frontends for agentic software backends.
- webassembly (wasm), its promise, and languages native to it such as assemblyscript, moonbit.
- designing local AI powered, multi-step, multi-agent, DAG-based orchestrator system runtimes and surrounding tooling in rust, zig, odin, & nim for fast, lightweight, efficient, local, general-purpose arbitrary agentic workflows with small language models (SLMs).
- nim, and the quest to discover and document the uncharted capabilities of an obscure yet handily powerful, python-like, systems programming language.

I started writing code and tinkering with systems as a hobby over a decade ago, beginning my career as a scripter/modder for the GTA series of video games. If I'm not upto something, I usually spend my time recreationally learning about and hopping between fields such as:

 - quantum information/computing
 - numerical methods/analysis
 - scientific and high performance computing
 - data science/engineering
 - AI/ML/DL/CV/NLP
 - robotics, automation, and control
 - IoT, embedded, GPUs, and hardware accelerators
 - compilers and their backends, LLVM IR, MLIR, optimizations
 - devtooling and devex
 - web/mobile/desktop and application development
 - classical information/coding theory
 - graphics and game development
 - IT, network, and systems engineering
 - devops and infrastructure design
 - computation, programming language design, automata, and type/category theory

in no particular order.
